# Sentimental-Analysis-of-Movie-data
Built a classifier which will predict whether a movie review is positive or negative. The model will take input a movie review and give output whether it is positive or negative. We have build the Model with different classifications Algorithm like KNN(K nearest numbers), Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM(Support Vector Machine).
After evaluation we found that SVM (support vector machine) has the best accuracy.
